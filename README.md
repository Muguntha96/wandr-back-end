# Wandr
## Project Description :
Wandr is a web-based application with a mission to inspire individuals to step out of their comfort zones, explore diverse cultures, landscapes, and create lasting memories. We believe that every journey has a unique story, and by sharing these stories, we aim to inspire others to embark on their own adventures. Through our platform, we provide resources, inspiration, and a community for travelers to connect, exchange ideas, and foster a sense of belonging. Together, we're making the world a more connected and inspired place.
## Planning Material :
The planning materials are available on the Trello board linked [here](https://trello.com/b/CDqA4iHA/wandr), which contains the project's user stories, ERD, and wireframes.
